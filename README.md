#### Credit Risk Analysis Report

1. **Analysis Overview:** 
The purpose of this analysis was to identify whether or not credit borrowers were considered high-risk or safe. This was done by  building a model using a dataset of lending activity. When consulting the classification report, 0 represents a healthy loan (the borrower will be pay back the loan) while 1 represents a high-risk loan.


2. **The results:** Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.
* Accuracy score : The accuracy score was .99, or 99%, meaning the model performed with almost perfect accuracy.

* Precision score : The percentage of correct positive predictions to total positive predictions. Out of all the borrowers the model predicted would be considered high-risk, 85% were actually high-risk. Out of all the borrowers the model predicted to be safe, 100% of them were safe.

* Recall score: Out of all the borrowers that were labeled high-risk, the model predicted the outcome correctly for 91% of them. Out of all the borrwers labeled safe, the model predicted the outcome correctly for 99% of them.

3. **A summary:** Summarize the results from the machine learning model. 
I would recommend the model be used by the company because it predicted the outcome of repayment with 99% accuracy.
