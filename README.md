# Credit Risk Prediction  
Welcome to the Credit Risk Classification repository! In this project, you'll embark on an exciting journey to develop a model that can assess and predict loan risk. Your mission is to leverage various data science techniques to analyze historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company. Ultimately, you'll build a powerful model capable of identifying the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Project Overview
Lending institutions face the ongoing challenge of assessing loan applicants' creditworthiness to minimize financial risk. In this challenge, you will work with a rich dataset containing historical lending data. Your primary objectives include:

* Data Exploration: Dive into the dataset to gain a deep understanding of its structure, features, and any potential data quality issues.

* Feature Engineering: Create relevant features that can help the model make accurate predictions about loan risk.

* Model Training: Implement and train machine learning models using a variety of techniques, such as classification algorithms, to predict loan risk.

* Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of your models using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques, such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

* Interpretability: Aim to create models that provide insights into why a particular loan application is deemed risky or not.

## Getting Started
The instructions are are divided into the following subsections:

* Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

* Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

* Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
Open the starter code notebook and use it to complete the following steps:

1. Read the `lending_data.csv` data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Create the labels set (`y`) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (`X`) DataFrame from the remaining columns. A value of 0 in the “loan_status” column means that the loan is healthy. A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.
3. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using `train_test_split`.
## Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
Use your knowledge of logistic regression to complete the following steps:

1. Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`).

2. Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (`X_test`) and the fitted model.

3. Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:

* Generate a confusion matrix.

* Print the classification report.

## Credit Risk Analysis Report

1. **Analysis Overview:** 
The purpose of this analysis was to identify whether or not credit borrowers were considered high-risk or safe. This was done by  building a model using a dataset of lending activity. When consulting the classification report, 0 represents a healthy loan (the borrower will be pay back the loan) while 1 represents a high-risk loan.


2. **The results:** Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.
* Accuracy score : The accuracy score was .99, or 99%, meaning the model performed with almost perfect accuracy.

* Precision score : The percentage of correct positive predictions to total positive predictions. Out of all the borrowers the model predicted would be considered high-risk, 85% were actually high-risk. Out of all the borrowers the model predicted to be safe, 100% of them were safe.

* Recall score: Out of all the borrowers that were labeled high-risk, the model predicted the outcome correctly for 91% of them. Out of all the borrwers labeled safe, the model predicted the outcome correctly for 99% of them.

3. **A summary:** Summarize the results from the machine learning model. 
I would recommend the model be used by the company because it predicted the outcome of repayment with 99% accuracy.
